Version 0.1 [2013-6-6]

o First internal release for Stanford Canary Center for Cancer
	Early Detection as primary beta testers.
o Implementation of MSImageSet S4 class; mass spectra are stored as a
	flat matrix with rows as features and columns as pixels; original
	data cube can be reconstructed dynamically using a position array;
	spectra stored using environments to prevent redundant data copying.
o Visualization that includes plotting ion images and mass spectra,
	using both base graphics and lattice graphics, allowing trellis
	display of multiple ion images and multipe mass spectra.
o Pre-processing for that includes normalization, baseline correct,
	peak-picking, peak-alignment, resampling, and binning.
o Multivaritate statistical analysis includes PCA, PLS, and OPLS.
o Supervised analysis includes a spatially-aware version of nearest
	shrunken centroids, PLS-DA, and OPLS-DA.
o Unsupervised analysis includes spatially-aware clustering based on
	nearest shrunken centroids, and an implementation based on sparse
	k-means.
o GUI based on tcltk using rpanel that supports all major
	processing and statistical analysis methods in the package,
	except for PLS and OPLS.
